# Plover Talk

### For the Ottawa Python Authors meetup group

#### Presentation date: Thursday, January 28th, 2016. 7:30 p.m. EST for 30-45 minutes.

## TODO:

- Everything
- Confirm Mirabai's availability
- Write summary blurb
- Enumerate possible topics
- Decide on format
- Consider live components/audience participation

### Summary Blurb

Summary is required to tell people what the presentation will be about on the website. Need to know if Mirabai is available in order to tell whether or not we will have captioning.

*This event will talk will be live captioned for the deaf or hard of hearing.* Writing at 225 words per minute using Plover, open source stenography software. Plover brings the art of machine stenography, an art older than computers, into your hands. You can use its amazing speed and efficiency for any computer task from writing into Facebook chat all the way to programming and window management.
 Plover's lead maintainer, Ted Morin, will talk about the technology behind Plover and explain how stenography fits into the modern world, one no longer lead by capitalist proprietary companies, but instead by curious hackers as a part of the open source movement.

### Topics

Just writing some ideas down on what I *could* talk about. This crowd tends to lean a little more technical, but often the topics described aren't as foreign as stenography. I figure that the crowd will probably want to know how the system works technically, but will especially be curious about the typing speeds and the benefits to them.

#### Non-technical

- History of steno; the usual spiel
  + OSP & Knight, Lifton, and Fisher saving the day / changing my life as a programmer and typing enthusiat
- Speed (TypeRacer)
- Accessibility
- Programming
- Layout
- Basic theory/demo

- My history
  + Often people rebute steno, citing the failure of Dvorak or Colemak. The systems really aren't comparable, and I'd like to try to emphasize that by explaining that I've learned Dvorak, Colemak, Workman, and (still use) Norman. Steno is just a completely different beast.

#### Pythonic!!

- High-level diagram of the system:
  + Machine --> Interpreter --> Orthography rules --> OS Layer
- Technologies: wxPython, pySerial, hid interfaces
- Caveats: emoji, keyboard suppression

#### Unsolved problems/call for help

- Conceptual solution to holding down modifiers
- GitHub issues: customizable key layout, new UI framework, conversion to Python 3, open to new coders for simple things like documentation.
